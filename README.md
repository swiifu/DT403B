### üí° What is this project?
The DT403B Microsoft Licensing Dashboard is a front-end application built with **React and Vite**, designed to display Microsoft CSP Licensing products in a user-friendly and interactive dashboard. It's purpose is to be an idea of a potential workplace application that could be used in pre-sales roles, leveraging our Microsoft CSP Partner **ArrowSphere** for quoting and visualising product data, I am developing a dashboard which could later on be a real tool we choose to use.

This dashboard is part of DT403B, showcasing my application of project management techniques and deployment practices such as:
- UI development with reusable components
- Version control (Git & GitHub)
- Cloud deployment
- Project methodologies
- Documentation
- Project and branching management
